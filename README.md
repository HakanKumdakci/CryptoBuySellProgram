# CryptoBuySellProgram
Looks for 24 indicator and shares the number of indicator which says Buy sell or neutral

NOTE: I looked up for results for 2 days then I think it has unconsistent results. I do not recomment to sell or buy according to program!. I wont have any responsibility.

before running you need to install requirements via pip3 It works via python3 trader.py

It shows in 2h indicators. You can change this from code.
